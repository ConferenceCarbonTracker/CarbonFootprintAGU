## Summary

More than 24,000 scientists from at least 101 countries will participate in the [American Geoscience Union's (AGU) Fall Meeting 2019](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting) hold in San Francisco, USA. 
We estimate that these scientists will travel in total 244 million km to San Francisco and back, which emits 69,300 tC02e, an average of 2.9 tCO2e per scientist. 
98% of these carbon emissions result from long-haul flights (>1500km). 
Relocating the AGU Fall Meeting to Chicago, USA, a location that is nearly optimal to minimize to total distance covered, reduces the emissions by 12%.
If the equivalent of the 17% highest emitting attendees would participate virtually, then the carbon emissions would be reduced by 39%. Virtual participation for 36% of the highest emitting attendees would reduce the carbon footprint by 76%. 
Only a format in which the conference is hold biennially in Chicago with virtual participation for 36% of attendees would reduce the travel carbon footprint by more than 90%.

## 1. Introduction

International aviation is projected to contribute 22% to global greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 [[1](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/569964/IPOL_STU(2015)569964_EN.pdf)], as doubling of passengers is expected by 2036 [[2](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2017-10-24-01.aspx)]. In Paris 2015, world governments have agreed to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C [[3](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2016/02/20160215%2006-03%20PM/Ch_XXVII-7-d.pdf)], which requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Universities and other research institutions are high emitters [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)], with individual carbon emissions an order of magnitude larger [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862)] than the suggested personal carbon allowance [[6](https://wordpress.hotorcool.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_Degree_Lifestyles_MainReport.pdf), [7](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/pdf), [8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719303229)]. Research-associated carbon emissions are dominated by air travel to conferences, meetings and for fieldwork [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)]. Recent studies suggest that academic air travel has limited direct link to professional success [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862), [9](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17450101.2019.1589727)].

Most conferences do not provide live-streaming, nor allow for remote-speaking, although alternatives exist. Very few conferences are fully virtual (e.g. [virtual island summit](https://www.islandinnovation.co/summit/)) and therefore often almost carbon neutral [[10](https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/)]. Continuous virtual seminar series allow for frequent academic exchange (e.g. [Virtual Blue COP 25](https://virtualbluecop25.org/)) sometimes with a focus on field-specific subjects (e.g. [EBUS Webinars](https://ebuswebinars.wixsite.com/ebuswebinars)). Live-streaming is provided by more conferences (e.g. [JuliaCon](https://juliacon.org/2019/), with an automatic archive on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6StY9tIJIUN3F_co9A0zh0H)), mainly to make them more accesible for participants with constraints on time, money, or freedom of travel.

The carbon footprint of most conferences and meetings is dominated by participants with disproportionate travel emissions due to long distance flights [[11](https://dx.doiorg/10.1038/news031208-13),[12](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.318.5847.36)]. For the EGU General Assembly 2012 it was estimated that 20% of the highest emitting participants are responsible for 70% of the travel emissions [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)]. Here, we calcuate the travel emissions for the AGU Fall Meeting in 2019 and present reduction scenarios based on relocation, to minimize the total distance covered, and virtual participation.
