## Summary

More than 24,000 scientists from at least 101 countries will participate in the [American Geoscience Union's (AGU) Fall Meeting 2019](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting) to be held in San Francisco, USA. 
We estimate that these scientists will travel in total 244 million km to San Francisco and back, which emits 69,300 tC02e, an average of 2.9 tCO2e per scientist. 
98% of these carbon emissions result from long-haul flights (>1500km). 
Relocating the AGU Fall Meeting to Chicago, USA, a location that is nearly optimal to minimize to total distance covered, reduces the emissions by 12%.
If the equivalent of the 17% highest emitting attendees would participate virtually, then the carbon emissions would be reduced by 39%. Virtual participation for 36% of the highest emitting attendees would reduce the carbon footprint by 76%. 
Only a format in which the conference takes place biennially in Chicago with virtual participation for 36% of attendees would reduce the travel carbon footprint by more than 90%.

## 1. Introduction

International aviation is projected to contribute 22% to global greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 [[1](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/569964/IPOL_STU(2015)569964_EN.pdf)], as doubling of passengers is expected by 2036 [[2](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2017-10-24-01.aspx)]. In Paris 2015, world governments have agreed to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C [[3](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2016/02/20160215%2006-03%20PM/Ch_XXVII-7-d.pdf)], which requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Universities and other research institutions are high emitters [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)], with individual carbon emissions an order of magnitude larger [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862)] than the suggested personal carbon allowance [[6](https://wordpress.hotorcool.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_Degree_Lifestyles_MainReport.pdf), [7](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/pdf), [8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719303229)]. Research-associated carbon emissions are dominated by air travel to conferences, meetings and for fieldwork [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)]. Recent studies suggest that academic air travel has limited direct link to professional success [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862), [9](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17450101.2019.1589727)].

Most conferences do not provide live-streaming, nor allow for remote-speaking, although alternatives exist. Very few conferences are fully virtual (e.g. [virtual island summit](https://www.islandinnovation.co/summit/)) and therefore often almost carbon neutral [[10](https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/)]. Continuous virtual seminar series allow for frequent academic exchange (e.g. [Virtual Blue COP 25](https://virtualbluecop25.org/)) sometimes with a focus on field-specific subjects (e.g. [EBUS Webinars](https://ebuswebinars.wixsite.com/ebuswebinars)). Live-streaming is provided by more conferences (e.g. [JuliaCon](https://juliacon.org/2019/), with an automatic archive on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6StY9tIJIUN3F_co9A0zh0H)), mainly to make them more accesible for participants with constraints on time, money, or freedom of travel.

The carbon footprint of most conferences and meetings is dominated by participants with disproportionate travel emissions due to long distance flights [[11](https://dx.doiorg/10.1038/news031208-13),[12](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.318.5847.36)]. For the EGU General Assembly 2012 it was estimated that 20% of the highest emitting participants are responsible for 70% of the travel emissions [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)]. Here, we calcuate the travel emissions for the AGU Fall Meeting in 2019 and present reduction scenarios based on relocation to minimize the total distance covered, and virtual participation.

Figure 4: USA (14222 scientists) and China (2266) are the biggest contributors to the total carbon emissions.

Figure 5: Carbon emissions sorted by highest per capita emissions. Each grey rectangle represents one country or US state, some of the largest in terms of emissions and participants are named. The 36% furthest-travelling AGU attendees (green lines) are responsible for 74% of the conference's total travel carbon footprint, with the top 17% (blue lines) responsible for 39% of the total.

Figure 6: The optimal location for the AGU Fall Meeting to minimize the total distance travelled. Optimal locations are shown in terms of the carbon emissions relative to San Francisco. The optimal location is in northern Wisconsin. Chicago is reasonably close to the optimal location and internationally easily accessible.
