## Summary

More than 24,000 scientists from at least 101 countries will participate in the [American Geoscience Union's (AGU) Fall Meeting 2019](https://www.agu.org/fall-meeting) to be held in San Francisco, USA. 
We estimate that these scientists will travel in total 244 million km to San Francisco and back, which emits 69,300 tCO2e, an average of 2.9 tCO2e per scientist. 
98% of these carbon emissions result from long-haul flights (>1500km). 
Relocating the AGU Fall Meeting to Chicago, USA, a location that is nearly optimal to minimize to total distance covered, reduces the emissions by 12%.
If the equivalent of the 17% highest emitting attendees would participate virtually, then the carbon emissions would be reduced by 39%. Virtual participation for 36% of the highest emitting attendees would reduce the carbon footprint by 76%. 
Only a format in which the conference takes place biennially in Chicago with virtual participation for 36% of attendees would reduce the travel carbon footprint by more than 90%.

## 1. Introduction

International aviation is projected to contribute 22% to global greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 [[1](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/569964/IPOL_STU(2015)569964_EN.pdf)], as doubling of passengers is expected by 2036 [[2](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2017-10-24-01.aspx)]. In Paris 2015, world governments have agreed to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C [[3](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2016/02/20160215%2006-03%20PM/Ch_XXVII-7-d.pdf)], which requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Universities and other research institutions are high emitters [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)], with individual carbon emissions an order of magnitude larger [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862)] than the suggested personal carbon allowance [[6](https://wordpress.hotorcool.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_Degree_Lifestyles_MainReport.pdf), [7](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/pdf), [8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699719303229)]. Research-associated carbon emissions are dominated by air travel to conferences, meetings and for fieldwork [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)]. Recent studies suggest that academic air travel has limited direct link to professional success [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311862), [9](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17450101.2019.1589727)].

Most conferences do not provide live-streaming, nor allow for remote-speaking, although alternatives exist. Very few conferences are fully virtual (e.g. [virtual island summit](https://www.islandinnovation.co/summit/)) and therefore often almost carbon neutral [[10](https://hiltner.english.ucsb.edu/index.php/ncnc-guide/)]. Continuous virtual seminar series allow for frequent academic exchange (e.g. [Virtual Blue COP 25](https://virtualbluecop25.org/)) sometimes with a focus on field-specific subjects (e.g. [EBUS Webinars](https://ebuswebinars.wixsite.com/ebuswebinars)). Live-streaming is provided by more conferences (e.g. [JuliaCon](https://juliacon.org/2019/), with an automatic archive on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6StY9tIJIUN3F_co9A0zh0H)), mainly to make them more accesible for participants with constraints on time, money, or freedom of travel.

The carbon footprint of most conferences and meetings is dominated by participants with disproportionate travel emissions due to long distance flights [[11](https://dx.doiorg/10.1038/news031208-13),[12](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.318.5847.36)]. For the [European Geoscience Union's General Assembly](https://egu2019.eu/) 2012 it was estimated that 20% of the highest emitting participants are responsible for 70% of the travel emissions [[4](https://tyndall.ac.uk/sites/default/files/twp161.pdf)]. Here, we calcuate the travel emissions for the AGU Fall Meeting in 2019 and present reduction scenarios based on relocation to minimize the total distance covered, and virtual participation.

### 3. Data

Data is based on the abstracts of the scientific programme [published by AGU](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Home/0), covering both oral and poster abstracts. We identified the presenting author from all 26,133 abstracts. Of those, we were able to geolocate the affiliations of 24,008 unique presenters. A list of numbers of presenters can be found in [`/data/locations.csv`](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU/blob/master/data/locations.csv) (per city), [`/data/emissions_per_country.csv`](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU/blob/master/data/emissions_per_country.csv) (per country), and [`/data/emissions_per_state.csv`](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU/blob/master/data/emissions_per_state.csv) (per state in the US).

### 4. Methods

All scripts can be found in [`/scripts`](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU/tree/master/scripts) and the assumptions are discussed in section [4.6](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU#46-sensitivity-to-assumptions).

### 4.1 Departure location

The departure location per attendee is assumed to be their affiliation's city. The named location `city, state, country` is converted to geographical coordinates with [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/) from the [OpenStreetMap database](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (see [`/scripts/get_locations.py`](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU/blob/master/scripts/geocode_locations.py)

### 4.2 Retour and other conferences

Every attendee is assumed to travel back to their departure location with the same mode of transport. Due to the lack of data, we have to assume that every scientists only came to San Francisco for the purpose of the AGU Fall Meeting. Some scientists likely connected their journey to San Francisco with other conferences, meetings or holidays.
  
### 4.3 Indirect journeys

We assume all journeys to be direct, that means, we calculate the distance as the great circle distance. This is more accurate for long-haul than for short-haul, and may have some considerable errors for rail, car or bus, but less than a factor of 2. More in section [4.6](https://github.com/milankl/CarbonFootprintAGU#46-sensitivity-to-assumptions).
  
### 4.4 Mode of transport

Rail, car or bus is assumed for all journeys with distances of less than 400km. Airplanes are assumed for longer distances. Short-haul is defined as distances of less than 1500km, distances up to 8000km are long-haul and longer distance are considered to be super long-haul.

### 4.5 Carbon emissions

The emission of rail, bus or car journeys are grouped and assumed to emit 60gCO2e / km / person.
[[13](http://ecopassenger.hafas.de/hafas-res/download/Ecopassenger_Methodology_Data.pdf),
[14](http://www.cer.be/sites/default/files/publication/Facts%20and%20figures%202014.pdf),
[15](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/energy-efficiency-and-specific-co2-emissions/energy-efficiency-and-specific-co2-9),
[16](https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/1114/rail-infrastructure-assets-environmental-2017-18.pdf)]

The missions of flights are split into three categories

- 200gCO2e / km / person for short-haul,
- 250gCO2e / km / person for long-haul, and
- 300gCO2e / km / person for super long-haul.

These values take into account factors that typically decrease the per km emissions for long-haul flights such as [[17](https://www.atmosfair.de/wp-content/uploads/atmosfair-flight-emissions-calculator-englisch-1.pdf),
[18](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Documents/Methodology%20ICAO%20Carbon%20Calculator_v10-2017.pdf),[19](https://www.myclimate.org/fileadmin/user_upload/myclimate_-_home/01_Information/01_About_myclimate/09_Calculation_principles/Documents/myclimate-flight-calculator-documentation_EN.pdf)]

- increased fuel consumption for take-off
- decreased detour factors for longer flights
- average aircraft types and their fuel consumption
- average passenger load factors for average airlines.

Additionally, we take into account factors that typically increase the per km emissions for longer flights, which on average tend to outweigh the factors from above [[17](https://www.atmosfair.de/wp-content/uploads/atmosfair-flight-emissions-calculator-englisch-1.pdf)]

- increased fuel weight for longer flights
- increased flight altitudes depending on distance covered
- indirect CO2 effects on ozone and cloud formation depending on flight altitude [[20](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-018-1556-3)].

Some emission calculators do not include all of the factors above (e.g. [18](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Documents/Methodology%20ICAO%20Carbon%20Calculator_v10-2017.pdf) and [19](https://www.myclimate.org/fileadmin/user_upload/myclimate_-_home/01_Information/01_About_myclimate/09_Calculation_principles/Documents/myclimate-flight-calculator-documentation_EN.pdf)). To our knowledge, the atmosfair calculator [[17](https://www.atmosfair.de/wp-content/uploads/atmosfair-flight-emissions-calculator-englisch-1.pdf)] is the most sophisticated. It includes the indirect CO2 effects not just as a factor 2, as an approximation recommended by [Jungbluth and Meili, 2019 ([20])](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-018-1556-3) but makes this factor flight altitude dependent (as recommended as a next order accuracy therein). Additionally, atmosfair's calculator uses a database which analysed the aircraft types, their fuel consumption and passenger loads typically flown on specific routes. We therefore obtained our assumed emissions values by searching for typical flight routes to Vienna and simplified the results.

We assume economy class for every participant.

Carbon emissions of live-streaming are assumed to be negligible.

### 4.6 Sensitivity to assumptions

Sensitivity to the assumptions is fairly low. Main contributions to the uncertainty of the carbon footprint are

a) **The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of long-haul and super long-haul flights**. These are assumed to be 250g and 300g CO2e / km / person, respectively, which is a representative average with probably less than 10% error [[17](https://www.atmosfair.de/wp-content/uploads/atmosfair-flight-emissions-calculator-englisch-1.pdf)]. The emissions of individual flights have much higher uncertainty and depend on number of passengers, airline / flight class, type of aircraft, potential detours, flight altitude, and weather conditions. The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of super long-haul flights (>8,000km) are usually higher due to additional fuel weight and flight altitude, although increased fuel consumption from start and detour contribute less for such long distances.

b) **The exact route travelled by every attendee.** We have to assume great circle distances for every route travelled, although most attendees have to travel to the closest international airport first. Some routes require stopovers at airports that usually come with some detour. It is assumed that these detours rarely add more than 20% to the distance covered. As most attendees arrive from major cities with direct connections to San Francisco, we consider this uncertainty to contribute less than 10% to the total travel carbon footprint.

c) **The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of rail, bus or car journeys.**
These are assumed to be 60gCO2e / km / person, which we estimate as an average [[13](http://ecopassenger.hafas.de/hafas-res/download/Ecopassenger_Methodology_Data.pdf),
[14](http://www.cer.be/sites/default/files/publication/Facts%20and%20figures%202014.pdf),
[15](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/energy-efficiency-and-specific-co2-emissions/energy-efficiency-and-specific-co2-9),
[16](https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/1114/rail-infrastructure-assets-environmental-2017-18.pdf)],
due to the lack of data on modes of transport.
Emissions from individual journeys can, however, vary by an order of magnitude depending on the type of bus or car, type of train (electric, diesel, highspeed or regional), the local energy mix (for electric), number of passengers, etc. 
As the contribution of rail, bus or car journeys to the overall carbon footprint of AGU-related travel is negligible (<1%), the uncertainty here is negligible too.
